  <!-- GENERAL EXPERIENCE -->
  <div class="exp-card">
    <h2>Overall Experience</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout my academic journey at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), I have
      actively participated in and managed various programmes and events. From
      Semester 1 until Semester 5, I have been involved in organising, coordinating,
      and handling different types of programmes, which helped me develop strong
      leadership, communication, and organisational skills.

      2025 and Karnival INFOFEST 2026. These programmes required strong teamwork,
      effective communication, and proper planning to ensure smooth execution.
      Through these events, I gained hands-on experience in event coordination,
      problem-solving, and professional collaboration.
